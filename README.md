Project scope: To create a puzzle simulator game comprising of multiple puzzles with randomly generated answers which players must exercise brainpower and memorisation to derive the answers to


Project scope extended:
We aim to create a 2D puzzle simulator game with horror elements. The gameplay loop is split into two segments, a study seegment and a "test" segment. During the study segment, 
the player will have to manage their limited time and sanity to spend as much time as possible memorising the answers to the puzzles which will happen in the test segment of the game.
The test segment of the game consists multiple minigames. These minigames feature randomly generated answers. Additionally, the answers cannot be directly memorised. Instead, the 
player should have to exercise memory and brainpower to DERIVE the answer based on information given during the study segment. Overall, we aim to challenge ourselves by implementing multiple
smaller minigames with diverse mechanics in order to broaden our understanding of C# and Unity for game development.

Milestone 1 (Project motivation, proposed core features/user stories, design and plan)

Project motivation: 
We were both motivated by the desire to do game development in the future. We were inspired by puzzles games such as Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes(KTANE) and Papers, Please. They
are both fundamentally simple games with interesting premise/playstyles (i.e. using a manual in KTANE to work out puzzles with a second player), so we decided to try our hand at implementing a similar idea.
We also set the game in a setting that is close to our hearts, university, which inspired the name and general digital exam/study aesthetics. In order to add an additional layer of challenge to the game, 
as well as reflect how many students feel during the university semester, we decided to add a strict timer and sanity system, which is meant to reflect students balancing their mental and physical health needs 
while studying during the exam period. We ultimately hope to be able to create a game which depicts a students' struggle to balance the three S-es (Sleep, study and social life), while providing a nice challenge for
our players' brains at the same time.

Proposed core features:
1. Sanity and time system - Players should maintain their characters sanity. Losing all their sanity will constitute a loss scenario. They can maintain their sanity by sleeping or socialising
2. Puzzle and manual system - Players should read the manual to learn the method to derive an answer from the puzzles which will come out during the "test" phase. These puzzles have randomly generated solutions, so no two
playthroughs of the game should feautre the same combination of puzzles or solutions, increasing replayability. The players will be encouraged to try to memorise the answers to the puzzles, or at most, "bring in" one double-sided A4
cheatsheet to the test phase. This is dependent on the players' integrity.
3. Game progression - The game should get harder as the game progresses, which means the puzzles should be scalable in terms of difficulty, either in terms of number of puzzles, or the complicatedness of the puzzle itself. This also
ties in with a side feature, an endless mode where players can endlessly practice on increasingly difficult puzzles

Design:
We have chosen a pixel art based design because we took inspiration from Faith: The Unholy Trinity as a game which can inspire many feelings from a simple art style. Also, we hope to allow as many people to enjoy the game even without strong
hardware.

The designs are drawn on Aseprite and the inspiration for the symbols are from apps commonly used by university students (Telegram, Examplify, PDFs, etc.)

SFX were entirely generated on SFXR, a free 16-bit audio SFX generator sourced online.


Plan:
By 2nd June - Create 4 puzzles, along with basic UI.
By 9th June - Create 4 more puzzles, finish the core sanity and time system, along with simple UI representation
By 16th June - Create 2 more unique puzzles, finish SFX implementation, finish writing dialogue and storyline
By 23rd June - Create 2 more unique puzzles, touch up UI, implement nightmare sequences, collecting motivational message/stories by students for extension feature of game
By 30th June - Ceate last 4 unique puzzles, touch up art, finish endless mode
1st July - 14th July - User testing, Fixing bugs, touching up art, finishing nightmare sequence, adding other extension features (TBC)
15th July - 30th July - Finalise art and music. (Maybe look into somehow implementing a modding API?)
1st Aug - Splashdown - Bug fixing, player testing
